This is a simple personal portfolio website built using HTML and basic CSS. It consists of two main pages:

Home Page – Showcases a brief introduction and purpose of the portfolio.

Contact Page – Allows visitors to get in touch through listed contact information.

This project is ideal for beginners who want to understand how to structure a basic website with clean and minimal design. No frameworks or advanced styling – just pure HTML and CSS.
